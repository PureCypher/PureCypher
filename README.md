# Hi all

I programme random stuff which sometimes make it onto my Github. I mainly programme in Python, I am able to programme in JavaScript, C++, C# but only very basically since I haven't programmed in them recently/ still learning the ways.

# Hobbies
 - Robotics
 -- I am wanting to create a version of the Darpa Tank that showed their improvements made on the tanks suspension as shown: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUsyMDvPW6U&ab_channel=DARPAtv
 
 - Electronics
 -- I am wanting to make things. 
 -_- For example Rubber ducky
 - Gaming
